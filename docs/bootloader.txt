What's in this file
===================================
This file explains the changes that have bee made to the bootloader. It also
explains how to use the new bootloader to load new sub-modules.


What's changed
===================================
The bootloader now is able to load data above the 1 MiB real mode limit. This
is the main change to the bootloader.


How this is accomplished
===================================
In short the bootloader uses the read_prog function to read a few sectors into
a temporary buffer that's below 1MiB. Then the bootloader switches to
protected mode and copies the buffer to the correct location. Then it repeats
until there is no more data to be read.
