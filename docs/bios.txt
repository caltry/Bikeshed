The BIOS Call System
-----------------------

BIOS calls are possible in bikeshed with the _bios_call() function.  This
function takes a struct of registers to set before calling a BIOS function and
the interrupt number to call.  When the BIOS call is complete, the resulting
registers are captured and returned in an update Regs struct.

The _bios_call() method is written in x86 assembly and loaded seperately to
the rest of the kernel.  The function switches between real and protected mode
to make the BIOS call.
