NAME
       fs_write - write directly to a file

SYNOPSIS
       #include <ulib.h>

        typedef enum {
                FS_E_OK         = 0,	// No error
                FS_E_NOFILE     = 1,	// File not found
                FS_E_BADFD      = 2,	// Not a valid file descriptor
                FS_E_IO         = 3,	// An I/O error occurred.
                FS_E_NOT_FQN    = 4,	// The path give is not fully qualified
                FS_BAD_OFFSET	= 5,	// Offset is past the end of the file
        } FSStatus;

       FSStatus fs_write
                (const char *path,
                void *buf,
                Uint32 *bytes_written,
                Uint32 offset,
                Uint32 nbytes);

DESCRIPTION
       fs_write() attempts to write up to _nbytes_ to the file path _path_
       from _buf_. Writing begins at _offset_ bytes into the file.  Stores the
       number of _bytes_written_.

RETURN VALUE
        On success, returns FS_E_OK. On error, returns one of the following:

ERRORS
        FS_E_NOFILE
                No file with that name exists.
        FS_E_IO
                An unknown I/O error occurred
        FS_E_NOT_FQN
                The path specified isn't a complete path to the file from the
                root of the directory tree.
        FS_BAD_OFFSET
                The offset into the file is past the current end of the file.

NOTES
        This interface provides no locking or guarentees of exclusive access
        to the file.
