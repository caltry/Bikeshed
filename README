Bikeshed Version:     0.0.1-pre-alpha1 (Ornery Orange)
README Last updated:  05/24/12
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build Bikeshed:

	* run 'make' in your project directory

	This will make a file named usb.image that can be copied to a
	usb drive with the dd command.

Other make targets:

	* novideo
		This makes a version of Bikeshed with the video component
		disabled.  No graphical user programs will run in this mode.

	* qemu
		Build a version of Bikeshed suitable for running on qemu

	* prog.nl (in src/)
		Namelist of all global symbols, their values, and the program
		section they're defined in (Text, Data, Bss).

	* BuildImage (in build/)
		A program used to patch the system length into the boot sector
		of the disk.image file.

	* FancyCat (in build/)
		A program used to create a payload containg the kernel and other
		payloads to be placed in memory (like the ramdisk).  Creates
		images compatable with the Bikeshed bootloader.
	
	* prog.dis (in src/)
		A disassembly of the prog.o file - a text version of the
		binary machine code.
	
Loading additional files:

	You can load additional files into memory by adding the name of
	the file and the address where you want it loaded to the end of
	the FancyCat command in the Makefile.
