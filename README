Bikeshed Version:     0.0.1
README Last updated:  05/22/12
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build Bikeshed:

	* run 'make' in your project directory

	This will make a file named usb.image that can be copied to a
	usb drive with the dd command.

To copy Bikeshed onto a USB flash drive:

	All machines in the DSL have at least two front-panel USB slots
	located at the bottom on the front of the machine; some have a
	third slot, located next to the floppy disk drive.  Under Ubuntu,
	you can use any of these slots; insert a flash drive, and the OS
	automatically creates device entries for the drive, using the
	next available disk name in /dev (e.g., /dev/sdg).

	Because the name of the device in the filesystem varies depending
	on the number and type of disk drives in the system, special
	files named /local/devices/disk on each DSL system.  This file
	has the necessary major/minor device numbers to work with the
	plugged-in flash drive.

	To copy your bootable image to the flash drive, plug the drive
	into a USB socket, wait a few moments for Ubuntu to recognize
	it and create the device entries in /dev, and type

		make usb

	This will remake the usb.image file (if necessary), and will then
	copy it out to /local/devices/disk.

To boot your program:

	* be sure you have copied it to a bootable medium
	* shut down Ubuntu by executing the 'uhalt' command
	* insert the bootable medium
	* push the reset button on the front of the machine

	DO NOT just push the reset button - Ubuntu must be shut down
	correctly in order to avoid damaging the filesystems.

To reboot Ubuntu:

	* take your bootable medium out of the machine
	* push the reset button

Compiling your program creates several files:

	prog.o	linked, object form of the system

	prog.b	binary version of the system - generated from prog.o
		by removing all the object file headers and symbol table

	prog.nl	namelist of the prog.o file - lists all global symbols,
		their values, and the program section they're defined in
		(Text, Data, Bss)

	*.image	the binary system image - contains the bootstrap, the
		protected mode startup code, and your stuff, in this layout:

			bootstrap	first sector
			switch code	second sector
			your program	sectors 3 through n+2
			next file	n+3 through p+n+2
			next file	p+n+3 through q+p+n+2
			etc. (see below)

		This file will be named floppy.image or usb.image,
		depending on which device you'll be using.
	
	BuildImage used to patch the system length into the boot sector
		of the disk.image file
	
	Offsets	prints byte offsets for major structures (only present
		in SP2 distributions)

Other things you can 'make':

	prog.dis a disassembly of the prog.o file - a text version of the
		binary machine code
	
	clean	deletes all object, listing, and binary files

	depend	recreates the dependency lists in the Makefile
	
Loading additional files:

	You can load additional files into memory by adding the name of
	the file and the address where you want it loaded to the end of
	the BuildImage command in the Makefile.  However, because the
	loading is done in real mode, you cannot load into addresses
	above 0x9ffff.
